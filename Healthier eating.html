    <h1>Eating well:</h1>
    <p>Eating well involves making nutritious food choices that promote overall health and well-being. <br>It focuses on balance, variety, and moderation in your diet, ensuring that you get the necessary nutrients your body needs. <br>Here are some key components:

        Balanced Diet: A well-rounded diet includes a mix of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) <br>and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). <br>This balance helps maintain energy levels and supports bodily functions.
        
        Whole Foods: <br>Prioritizing whole, minimally processed foods—such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats—can enhance nutrition and provide essential nutrients.</p>
