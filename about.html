    <h1>About Healthy Food:</h1>
    <p>Healthy food refers to eating habits that prioritize nutrient-dense, whole foods, which support overall <br>health and prevent chronic diseases. <br>A healthy diet includes a variety of foods that provide essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. <br>These nutrients are crucial for maintaining energy levels, <br>promoting proper growth and development, and supporting the immune system.
        <p>Balance and Variety: <br> A healthy diet includes a wide range of foods from different food groups such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. <br>This ensures that the body receives a broad spectrum of nutrients.</p>


        <p>Improved Digestion: Foods high in fiber, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, <br> promote healthy digestion and help prevent issues like constipation.

            Weight Management: Eating nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods helps maintain a healthy weight without the need for restrictive diets.</p>

            <p>Better Mood and Mental Health: Studies show that a diet rich in whole foods, <br>especially those high in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon and walnuts) and antioxidants (like berries), can boost mood and cognitive function.

                Stronger Immune System: <br>A balanced diet full of vitamins and minerals strengthens the immune system, making it easier for the body to fight off illness.</p>
